## Impact of Technologies

      These emerging technologies have the possibility to greatly refine many aspects of a business, however, they also carry risk. This report will address the impact of the technologies mentioned in the Emerging Technology Report.

## Voice Conferencing

      -Acquisition
      Since programs like Zoom are cheap and easily used. A transition to hosting classes online would have a relatively  low footprint. Most of the course content should already be stored on a computer. Costs would include small amounts of training for instructors to learn the programs and the subscription fees which are also cheaper than the alternative of hosting the classes in person.

      -Removal
      Removal will benefit since there will no longer by a need to rent out space for the in person classes. There are no negatives from moving online.

      -Differentiating factors
      Classes in person can be more interactive and are great for networking. This is a small negative when compared to selling more courses and keeping customers happier with no commutes.

      -legal considerations
      Classes will be recorded online. Clients have to be okay with being recorded. Less risk of in-person OHS events.

## Satellite Imagery

      -Acquisition
      Satellite imagery that's 90 days old can be bought from worldview for as little as $22.50 a square km with a wait of 1 to 4 weeks. This is leagues cheaper and faster than aerial photography and carries very little risk. It would be a seamless transition from helicopter photography with no negatives.

      -Removal
      The method of aerial surveying will remain an option. RegenTech reserves the choice of choosing which method for each farm. There are no contracts. There is no cost of removal.

      -Differentiating factors
      Aircraft photography can be more flexible and instantaneous, But post processing is more time consuming. Satellite Imagery is cheap when you buy 3 month of photos from their database. If you want to pay for a current time photo it may cost far more.

      -legal considerations
      nil

## Smart Sensors

      -Acquisition
      Smart Sensors will have an expensive initial cost, and medium maintenance cost but a great investment in the long term. They will quickly pay their selves off in a few years rather than decades. Decent amount of training will be required for staff to understand the technology and systems built to use it. Will free up RegenTech's staff from having to visit farms to take samples and data manually and move those staff to maintaining the sensors.

      -Removal
      Clients will likely have teething issues when losing their old system of simple data on paper. Transition to this system will financially pay off the initial cost in the long term and free up a lot of time. The benefits are endless

      -Differentiating factors
      Cheaper labour costs
      medium/higher ongoing costs
      increased production
      massive efficiency upgrades
      moderate training required
      system overhaul
      instantaneous information
      exciting technology
      private
      Some failure rate to be expected
      
      -legal considerations
      All data must be protected under an NDA
      contracts will have to be set up with smart sensor suppliers
      contracts will have to set up if clients want RegenTech to be involved.
