# Skynet Research - Response And Strategy Report For RegenTech

##### Authored by Robert Blackshaw

## Introduction
      This report will discuss the implementation steps for each technology. 

<br />

## Voice Conferencing
      The benefits of using Voice Conferencing software far outweight the negatives of staying with the offline course. The first stage of transition will be for RegenTech to download, subscribe and experiment with Zoom software. The instructors also require webcams and microphones. It is worth getting multiple incase of an equipment failure in the middle of class. A few days is all that is required to become comfortable with creating and sharing rooms. A team organisiation program such as slack will be required. This can be used to share files and discuss classes with the farmers on a free server.

      Since teaching online compared to in-person is virtually the same. The first trial can be with the next class. Issues can easily be ironed out quickly on the go. The small disruptions that may occur during the first class will not hurt the experience as much as the clients being disrupted by having to attend phyical classes.

      Meetings should occur after classes for instructors to reflect on possible improvements to the system. Surveys for students are also a useful tool.

      If the first class is a success, plans to reorganize old class room space and materials can begin.

## Satellite Imagery
      Since the current aircraft photography technology is interchangable with the new satellite imagery technology there is no risk to trying it.

      Stage 1 will be to open lines of communication with Apollo mapping at: https://apollomapping.com/worldview-3-satellite-imagery
      A relationship will need to be built to establish the needs between client and provider.

      Stage 2 will be to run a trial of the new technology by revisiting and reattempting an old project using the satellite imagery. A worker should be delegated to recording and observing the process to measure the benefits and negatives.

      The team should see an instant benefit of receiving imagary instantly instead of waiting weeks for aircraft to get airborne. The team should also find another time reduction due to the satellite image not having to be patched together manually. This extra time should lead to more time for the visualization team to spend on the final product, increasing quality of output.

      Stage 3. A post trial meeting should be held to discuss pros and cons and decide on the primary technology moving forward. There are no further considerations since aircraft photography can be reverted to at any point should satellite imagery become non-optimal.

      It may be worth visiting Drone photography technology as a third option in the future.

## Smart Sensors
      
      The smart sensor transition will be lengthy and tedious. However, it is required to stay competitive in the future market.

      RegenTech has to decide whether it wants to supply its own smart sensors and background systems or suggest buisinesses already in the market and downsize its team.

      If RegenTech wishes to downsize and save on it's data collection department, companies such as Farmdeck.com are potential supplier of sensors. They have an all in one package for sensors and the software that controls them. Farmers can be informed of these businesses and can choose the provider that suits them best. RegenTech can then downsize its data team and remove itself from that space.

      If Regentech wants to pursue a ongoing assistance business model, it would be worthwhile developing it's own all in one package for farmers. A supplier of sensors would have to be aquired and a software package built. It is heavily advised to hire an expert in this field to run this program who can save RegenTech from making major mistakes due to lack of experience.

      It is recommended to smart start small. There are hundreds of sensors that do different things, but starting with one problem at a time and rolling it out to all the farms, then growing from there, is the cleanest approach to smart sensor technology.
      
       Once the package has been developed. A suitable farm that RegenTech services can be trialed with the package. The Trial should take from 6 to 24 months for most errors and issues to be discovered and solved.       
       
      When confidence in the systems has reached a suitable level. they can be rolled out to old and new clients. The current staff that collect and process data can be retrained to maintain and install sensor technology.
