# Skynet Research - 3 Emerging Technologies And Their Practices For RegenTech
##### Authored by Robert Blackshaw
<br /><br />

## RegenTech 5 year goals
      -Online Course accessibility
      -Eliminate need for Helicopter Photography
      -Improve Immersive Visualization
      -Adaptive Systems For Changing Weather Conditions
      -Investigate Expansion Towards Tractor Efficiency Consulting
      -Decrease Labour Costs Associated With Taking Measurements
      -Shorten Time Frame For Data Distribution
      -Provide More Meaningful Data 
<br />

## Satellite Imagery As A Solution To Helicopter Photography and Immersive Visualization
### - The Technology
      Currently aircraft photography surveying is slow and expensive. In 2014, DigitalGlobe launched 6 worldview 3 Satellites into orbit. These Satellites are repeatedly mapping Earth and updating an image of the world. Customer can request sections of the world image and receive it in minutes.

### - Satellite Imagery In Practice
      RegenTech's visualization team currently has to patch together images and videos from helicopter photography. Satellites can provide a single image of the entire landscape. This would allow the visualization team to spend more time developing the finished product and eliminate the need for helicopter photography.

## Video Conferencing In Response To Course Accessibility
### - The Technology
      Video calling software has become a common way for businesses to conduct meetings for almost 2 decades now. The software is now at a point where significant numbers of people can tune in remotely to see a presentation or contribute to a class live.

### - Video Conferencing In Practice
      Since the farmers report difficulties finding time to attend RegenTech's courses. The Planning stream at RegenTech can easily move the courses online via programs like Zoom, Skype and Discord. These programs allow attendees of the course to tune in from a computer, mobile or tablet device remotely. The sessions can also be recorded and made available for the clients to watch later. The eliminates the farmers difficulties finding time to attend.

## Smart Sensors In Response To Weather Conditions, Measurement Taking, Data Distribution and Data Quality.
### - The Technology
      As the size and power of computer chips has improved over the years, small smart gadgets and sensors that are connected to the internet are commonly available and are very useful. Their power is in that they can be assigned to monitor one job and relay information about the current status of the device at all times. For example, a sensor could constantly track the temperature and recording it on an application. Instead of requiring a person to manually record the temperatures throughout the day.

### - Smart Sensors In Practice
      RegenTechs current goals of adapting to weather conditions, measurement taking, data distribution and data quality can all be solved with Smart sensors.

      One such issue is the automatic irrigation systems on farms executing regardless of whether its raining or not. Sensors can be organised to only activate irrigation when moisture levels in the soil drop below a certain threshold. This leads to more ideal soil conditions, more growth and a reduction in wastage.

      The same concept can be applied to a range of issues across farms. Sensors solve the manual data collection problem. The data can be posted online and emailed the instant it's processed to solve the delay issue with physical mail delivery.

## Emerging Tractor Technology 
### - The Technology
      The latest in tractor consulting is route optimization for path planning. Using software models to find the most efficient route with least number of turns and highest average pass length.
